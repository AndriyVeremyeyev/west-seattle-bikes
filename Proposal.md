#### West Seattle Bikes

##### Description
West Seattle Bikes is a web store where consumers can buy bikes, bike parts, bike tools and accessories to it.
I would like to practice more with a typical selling store since it’s pretty relevant and in demand all around the world. People concentrate more and more on online shopping during quarantine and after it.

##### Use Case
Main users are people who like bikes, bike consumers, people who need a bike, bike parts, tools, accessories, and so on. I witnessed how two bike stores closed in my West Seattle area because everything goes online now. But the absence of specialized bike stores in a particular area is extremely inconvenient. My MVP goal for right now it’s just selling store where user can scroll down, take a look at available bikes, bike parts, and sort them by different categories and by them.

But in the future, it should be something more than just a bike store. It should be transformed to place for people from the local community with a passion for bikes where people can receive professional consultation, compare characteristics and quality of bikes and parts, read about Seattle bike news, and communicate with each other. The web app should aggregate bike news and interesting articles about bikes.
